Introduction
------------
This app uses San Francisco crime incidents to demonstrate how Splunk search results can be visualized as choropleth maps.

Installation
------------
Input the demo file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/appsapps/sfcrime/sf_crimes_2013_blockgroup.json.

To input the demo file from the GUI follow these menu options: Data inputs » Add data » Files & directories » Add new.

Be sure to look for the `More settings` option and then set the `Host field value` to 'sf_crimes_2013_blockgroup.json'

Usage
-----
These are examples of splunk searches you can run that make maps:

host=sf_crimes_2013_blockgroup.json | search COCAINE |stats count by block_offset
host=sf_crimes_2013_blockgroup.json | search ASSAULT |stats count by block_offset
host=sf_crimes_2013_blockgroup.json | search THEFT |stats count by block_offset

You can replace the words that are in caps above with other words you want to search that occur in the police crime incident events.
